Hi Friend, 
How are you doing?
I like your soft spokenness
But make sure you are not quiet
The world doesn't favour the quiet
It favours the outspoken more
Imagine your sweet melodious voice of soft spokeness laced with outspokenness
O, my, the world will be yours for the taking.
Keep smiling baby girl
It fits you more.
